Description: 
        => Water permeability prediction model
        
        - Description:
        k nearest neighbor regression model for prediction of the water permeability
        level of forest soil. The model is intended to be use in the forest industry to
        guide routing decisions in harvesting operations.
        
        The soil water permeability 𝑥𝑤𝑝 can be used as an indicator for the bearing capacity 
        of the soil, which is a crucially important factor in harvest operations with heavy machinery.
        
        The predicted value of 𝑥𝑤𝑝 will be used to guide routing decisions in order to minimize
        risks  for the forest harvester.
        
        A route consists from a fixed number of spatially distributed points, for all of which 
        we need a prediction on the 𝑥𝑤𝑝 level, in order to evaluate the route’s goodness.
        
        The predictions are made using the k Nearest Neighbors Algorithm with Euclidean distance.
        
        Azure Pipelines is used for continuous integration and development of this project.
